				<h1>Our story</h1>

			</div>	<!-- page-header -->

			<p>Leka is young startup that develops robotic and interactive smart toys for autistic children. Our first product, Moti, is a robotic ball, sensitive to its environment, that moves on its own and changes colors to express its feelings. You can discover it and pre-order it here : <a href="http://discovermoti.com" title="Venez découvrir Moti">http://discovermoti.com</a></p>


			<p>Leka was born on the very benches of our <a href="http://www.ebi-edu.com/index2.htm" title="Site web de l'EBI">college</a> in 2012. From the beginning, it was obvious for us that what was just a college project was going to become a life project and an enterprise. Since February 2013, we are working full-time which allows us to be a lot more efficient and to progress faster!</p>

			<p>Throughout the adventure, many people have helped us, particularly during our fund raise on <a href="http://ulule.fr/balle" title="Campagne de crowdfunding Ulule">Ulule</a>. Here's a little something to thank them :)</p>

				<h2>Doing more with less</h2>

				<p>As a startup, our resources aren't limitless. Therefore, we need to take care of them, work with passion and do the maximum with what we have. Because we better go forward with the little we have than do nothing always waiting for something bigger.</p>

			</div>

			<div class="span4 mindset">

				<h2>keeping it simple and clever</h2>

				<p>We want our products to be user friendly, so that they don't require any complicated learning from the children, the parents and the professionals. We want our products to integrate themselves in the daily life, without rushing the habits, and become a new interface of communication and interaction. </p>

			</div>

			<div class="span4 mindset">

				<h2>Working with the our users</h2>

				<p>As soon as the project started, the team went to meet with the people affected by autism to better understand their needs and wishes. The project is therefore being built hand in hand with the children, the parents and the professionals to make sure that we are heading the right way.</p>

			</div>

		</div>

		<div class="row">

			<div class="span4 mindset">

				<h2>Remain honest and transparent</h2>

				<p>At Leka, we like to communicate about what we're doing, why we're doing it and who we're doing it for. We have nothing to hide. We are available, and present on the social networks, we talks about our life on our <a href="http://blog.weareleka.com" title="Suivez notre blog">blog</a>! We would love to answer your <a href="contact.php" title="Contactez nous">questions</a>, so don't hesitate.</p>

			</div>

			<div class="span4 mindset">

				<h2>Long live the open source and the open hardware!</h2>

				<p>An innovation won't have an impact unless it becomes global, and unless the people want to use it, modify it, and share the improvements with the rest of the community. That's why we use <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/" title="Arduino open source prototyping plateform">Arduino</a> for the development of our prototypes, and we decided to go open source on <a href="https://github.com/WeAreLeka" title="Page Github de WeAreLeka">Github</a>. Go fork my friends!</p>

			</div>

			<div class="span4 mindset">

				<h2>Believing in us and meeting new talents</h2>

				<p>At Leka, we have a strong and cohesive team, ready to move forward. We are proud of ourselves and of the work we accomplish everyday. We are always looking for talented people. Would you like to join us?<a href="jobs.php" title="jobs openings"> It's up to you to convince us!</a></p>
